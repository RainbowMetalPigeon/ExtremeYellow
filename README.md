# Pokémon Extreme Yellow
**Kanto at its max (and beyond!)**

This is a difficulty hackROM of Pokémon Yellow featuring much tougher battles; complex dungeons; restored content; more elaborated, deeper, and darker lore and story; completely new areas and story arcs; virtually infinite post-game content; a plethora of customization and randomization options.

*The project is close to completion, but still work-in-progress.* <br/>
*You can join Extreme Yellow Discord Server for more updates and discussions: https://discord.gg/QAX4c4xMJY*

## Credits (WARNING! CONTAINS SPOILERS!)

- pret (Pokémon Reverse Engineer Team) first and foremost, as they enabled me to work on this project in the first place
- Vortiene, for their invaluable help, suggestions, teaching, and support over the months; this game would have likely never seen the light of day without their help (their contributions include, but are definitely not limited to: code to give trainers' Pokémon Stat Exp; code to have the elevators' wirring depend on the number of traveled floors; code to expand the number of hideable sprites; code to allow instant re-usage of Repellent; directions on how to free needed memory; too many to be counted times when they taught me about assembly, Game Boy architecture, and RBY framework)
- jojobear13, for their precious technical insights and open-source bug-fixes (the code to give trainers' Pokémon Stat Exp was originally developed by them; they provided fundamental insights on a pesky TM-related bug; they implemented a new and better RNG)
- Porygondolier, not only for being a very pleasant and interesting person to interact with, but also for working with me on the mid-battle evolution (admittedly, they did most of the job!)
- Sanqui, for granting usage on the gen1-style sprites used in their Pokémon Red randomizer; all sprites that are not the original 151, Kleavor, Annihilape, Mega Evolutions, Anomalies*, MissingNo, or taken from Gold/Silver, are taken from their project; detailed credits to single artists can be found on their website
- Plague Von Karma, for some suggestions on speed-ups, providing the move deleter/relearner code (which uses code from jojobear13, based Mateo's code), as well as Kleavor and Annihilape sprites (I modified the latter)
- FrenchOrange, mauvesea, and LJSTAR, for their many many improvements and fixed on the sprites I drew; FrenchOrange drew the Flying Pikachu sprite
- Xillicis, for their tutorial on how to increase the number of usable Pokémon, as well as many useful exchanges over the months
- BlueZangoose, Mord, Cram-O-Dev for having helped, supported, motivated me and just being great people during this adventure of mine
- Mega Evolution, Eternamax Eternatus, Arceus, and Venustoise sprites are my own production, bar the aforementioned help
- Mega Rayquaza and Zygarde Complete sprites are from Axel-Comics: https://www.deviantart.com/axel-comics
- Green sprites are from Ghost-MissingNo: https://www.deviantart.com/ghost-missingno/art/Blue-Sprites-for-R-G-B-Y-339796334
- Yellow sprites are from LouLilie: https://www.deviantart.com/loulilie/art/PokemonSpecial-Sprites-Yellow-302559354
- PLEASE CONTACT ME if I forgot to add your name for anything of yours that I have used!!! In which case I first apologize, and then I'll put remedy as soon as possible!

(*) "Anomalies" refers to Zygarde Complete, Ultra Necrozma, Mega Rayquaza, Eternamax Eternatus, and Arceus.
